# K2.17 Source Fidelity Tranche Report

Source fidelity now includes bounded ANSI SGR extraction, a player-owned image resolver seam, and a bounded procedural-source registry for checkerboard, progress-bar, dots-spinner, and subcell-shape-atlas evidence. Unknown procedural generators report unsupported diagnostics instead of silently pretending to render.

Holdbacks remain explicit: no full VTE parser, no 256-color/truecolor ANSI parser, no image rasterization, and no external command execution.
